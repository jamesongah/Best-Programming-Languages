        <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
        <p>Have you ever visited a webpage? The majority of the entire world would say, “Yes!” Have you ever wondered what it took to make that webpage? The majority of the entire world would say, “No!” Those webpages are made up of large amounts of text, or <label class="definition" onclick="document.getElementById('codeBox').showModal();">code</label>. Other examples may include: games you play, like solitaire, or chess.com. All of these have been built off of some programming language. This article will hopefully help you choose a programming language to learn. We will be taking a deeper dive into these programming languages that seem complicated. Don’t worry, you do not have to understand these programming languages to understand this article.</p>
        <h2 id="lua">Lua</h2>
        <p>What is your favorite video game? I will be telling you about a little game called <label class="definition" onclick="document.getElementById('robloxBox').showModal();">Roblox</label>. Something special about this game is that it is written in Lua, a “lightweight, high-level, multi-paradigm programming language” (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language)">Wikipedia</a>) released in 1993. Something great about this language is that it is very easy to learn. It is so easy, in fact, that Roblox made an application called “Roblox Studio.” This <label class="definition" onclick="document.getElementById('appBox').showModal();">Application</label> makes it so you can create and program your own Roblox games to put on the website. This was the first one that I have learned because it is so much fun to make cool experiments. Lua even teaches you about programming necessities that are useful when you start another programming language.</p>
        <center><div class="tryityourself"><h2>Try it Yourself</h2><p>If you have Roblox downloaded, search through your computer using file explorer on windows under “This PC”. Search “Versions” and click on anything that contains the keyword “Roblox”. In this “Versions” folder, use the search bar again to search “.lua”, which is the file extension for Lua. This will appear a list of scripts that make the game run. Do not delete any of the scripts, this could lead to the game breaking. Now, double click on any of the files (if your computer prompts you what to open the file with, choose the pre-installed application “Notepad”.) You can see all of the lines of code that make up the game. This is a cool experiment to see Lua coded by a high level <label class="definition" onclick="document.getElementById('programmerBox').showModal();">programmer</label>.</p></div></center>
        <h2 id="html">HTML</h2>
        <p>HTML, also released in 1993, is an advanced programming language used everywhere. You may wonder what HTML might be. How many tabs do you have open in google chrome right now? Every single page that shows up when you click on a tab is likely programmed with HTML. This language is easy to start off with and can definitely land you a job in web development. This language is also the base for web games if you are interested in game development. HTML can teach you how to use strings, which are “these”, and how to define variables for other languages.</p>
        <center><div class="tryityourself"><h2>Try it Yourself</h2><p>Open up a new text document and type the following: 
“&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Your Text Here&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;”. You have successfully created an HTML file. All you have to do is save the file as a .html. Open the file with Chrome and you can see your text, or <label class="definition" onclick="document.getElementById('headBox').showModal();">heading</label>.</p></div></center>
        <h2 id="css">CSS</h2>
        <p>CSS is sort of joined with HTML. Its main purpose is to style an HTML document. Styles include: background-color, background-image, border, text-size, and thousands more! A great place to experiment with HTML, CSS, and another language I will soon talk about, go to codepen.io. CSS is “tied” to HTML because you program it inside an html document. It uses the “style” tag in HTML. I highly recommend learning HTML before CSS.</p>
        <h2 id="javascript">Javascript</h2>
        <p>The third HTML joined programming language is another, very famous, programming language many people enjoy… Javascript! This coding language offers high-level tasks it can do in just one document. If you are reading this, there is probably javascript involved with search engines. Data suggests 98% of websites today use Javascript on their sites. With Javascript classes, you can learn how to work variables, strings, arrays, functions, and way more. The fun web games students play in class are likely coded with Javascript. Learning it has its upsides. For one, you can get a job in game development and web development. Javascript also is very professional and looks incredibly nice and easy to read when programmed. I started to learn this in the 6th grade, so I believe you should learn it too. If Javascript is too easy or you want a harder programming language, try Python.</p>
        <h2 id="python">Python</h2>
        <p>Ever heard of cryptocurrencies? I haven’t until 7th grade. Python is a programming language that can do so much more than Lua HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Python can be written to solve super complex math equations and puzzles to mine cryptocurrencies. That is not all python is used with. Python is a language that can write useful <label class="definition" onclick="document.getElementById('programBox').showModal();">programs</label> to solve problems. Python is likely programmed using Windows, Mac OS, and Linux operating systems. This is because you have to download applications to program it. Many <label class="definition" onclick="document.getElementById('pythonPackageBox').showModal();">Python packages</label> keep being made making this programming language basically endless. Have fun programming!</p>
